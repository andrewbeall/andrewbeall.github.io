# Winchester Rifle

The iconic Wild West 1873 Winchester rifle modeled in Autodesk Maya 2018.  My goal for this model was to learn the process of making damaged wood and metal.  My process of creating this was to first get a low poly base model of the rifle.  I then upped the poly count by smoothing parts of the rifle that standout to the viewer.  The textures were made and finished product were rendered in Substance Painter 2018.

## Black Cherry-Bicycle 

A bicycle inspired by State Bicycle's HANZO bicycle modeled in Autodesk Maya 2018.  My goal for this model was to look a product and make my own iteration of it with a particular theme.  I used the color's of black cherry fruit for the inspiration of the color pallet of the Black Cherry-Biccycle.
