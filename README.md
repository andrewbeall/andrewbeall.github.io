##  Black Cherry Bicycle 

A bicycle inspired by State Bicycle's HANZO bicycle modeled in Autodesk Maya 2018.  My goal for this model was to look at a product and make my own iteration of it with a particular color scheme.  I used the color's of black cherry fruit for the inspiration of the color pallet of the Black Cherry-Bicycle.  The textures were made and finished product were rendered in Substance Painter 2018.

## Winchester Rifle

The iconic Wild West 1873 Winchester rifle modeled in Autodesk Maya 2018.  My goal for this model was to learn the process of making damaged wood and metal.  My process of creating this was to first get a low poly base model of the rifle.  I then upped the poly count by smoothing parts of the rifle that standout to the viewer.  The textures were made and finished product were rendered in Substance Painter 2018.

## Ryker's Helmet 

This helmet is the helmet of the Character Ryker who is featured in the 3d animated short: "Collector Corp".  The design of the helmet was inspired by Daft Punk's helmet and armor style from the Mass Effect videogame series.  I began my process by choosing the aesthetics from these two points that I wanted to incorporate.  The color skeme of Ryker's helmet is the same color scheme in the Colloector Corps. logo.  This 3d model was constructed, textured, and rendered in Autodesk Maya 2018.

## Prodigium

This is the terrain of the planet Prodigium which is in the 3d animated short "Collector Corp".  The goal for the model of the terrain was to create a mountainouse terrain with a small valley.  I created the terrain in Autodesk Maya 2018 using displacment maps and using them as stamps on a flat plane.  The mesh was created and rendered in Autodesk Maya 2018.
